                    EcoTransit is a decentralized application (dApp) built on VeChain and integrated with VeBetterDAO. It rewards users with $B3TR tokens for using eco-friendly public transport like buses, trains, trams, and metros.

                    Users can earn $B3TR tokens by verifying their public transport usage through OV card integration, QR & e-ticket scans, or NFC tap-in via smartphones. Rewards are based on distance traveled, consistency, and off-peak travel.

                    Travel verification is done through scanning tickets or e-tickets check-ins. 
                    Additionally, uploaded images of tickets are analyzed using an AI-based verification system with the following criteria:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The image must depict a valid ticket, receipt, or proof-of-purchase for public transport (bus, train, tram, or metro).</li>
                      <li>The ticket must be clear enough to display essential details such as date, departure/arrival locations, or transport provider branding.</li>
                      <li>The ticket's date must not be older than 14 days from the current date.</li>
                    </ul>
                    If the ticket meets all criteria, it is validated, and $B3TR tokens are awarded accordingly.
